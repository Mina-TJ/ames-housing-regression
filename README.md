# Ames Housing Regression
https://mina-tj.github.io/Ames-Housing-regression/

This repository contains my first academic regression analysis project, completed during the Fall 2025 semester.
It was a great learning experience, and I really enjoyed working with the code and visualizing
the results of my analysis using the Ames Housing dataset.

The full analysis, including code, charts, and explanations, is presented in the HTML file.
